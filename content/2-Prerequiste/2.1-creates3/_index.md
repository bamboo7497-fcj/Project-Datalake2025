In this step, you will create a new Amazon S3 bucket to store both raw and processed data. This bucket will act as the primary storage layer in your Data Lake Architecture and will be used by AWS Glue and Lake Formation.

Once completed, your S3 bucket will contain a well-defined folder structure supporting both input and output datasets for the Data Lake pipeline.

---

## Objectives:
- Create an Amazon S3 bucket
- Create folders: `raw/`, `processed/`
- Upload a sample CSV file **[sales_data.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19I5a0aUAFwI2Aw7lEbjFl88UlGgi-gvAzsdmF61vqhA/edit?usp=sharing)** to the `raw/` folder

Notes
{{% /notice %}}

- Record the full S3 path to your file (e.g., `s3://datalake-demo-yourname/sales_data.csv`) for later use in Glue Crawlers.
- Avoid using capital letters or spaces in bucket and folder names.
- The IAM Role created in [Step 2.2](../2.2-create-iam-role/) must have permission to access this bucket.
