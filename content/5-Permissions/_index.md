# Chapter 5 – Access Control with Lake Formation

In this chapter, you will configure fine-grained access control for your data lake using AWS Lake Formation. You will register S3 locations as data lake storage, grant access at table or column level, and verify that permissions apply correctly during querying.

---

## 🔍 Steps in this chapter:

- **[5.1 – Register data in Lake Formation](5.1-registerdata/)**  
- **[5.2 – Set up permissions](5.2-setuppermissions/)**  
- **[5.3 – Cross-check query from Athena](5.3-crossqueryathena/)**

By the end, your Data Lake will be governed with secure and centralized access control.
