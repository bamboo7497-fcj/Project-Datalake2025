# Chapter 4 ‚Äì Transform Data with AWS Glue Job

In this chapter, you will use **AWS Glue Studio** to create and run an **ETL job** that:

- Reads raw data from S3
- Applies transformations like renaming columns, mapping, filtering
- Writes processed output to a different S3 folder in Parquet format

This job is a key step between ingestion and analytics, helping normalize and prepare your data.
